# Inter-4

This is a project made in the fourth term of Game Design college.
It's a topdown shooter for mobile, where you must find and defeat viruses in order to harvest their materials to make vaccines.

The game has an upgrade system, items, different enemy AIs and lots of stuff. You're more than welcome to take a look :D
